The NestJS authentication (auth) setup in the provided code allows for user registration, login, and protected route access using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 
This setup provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for handling authentication in a NestJS application. It can be further extended to include features like role-based access control, 
token expiration handling, refresh tokens, and more.
